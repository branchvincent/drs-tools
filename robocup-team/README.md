# Project: Implementation
## Hayden Bader, Bill Sun, Gao Tang, Branch Vincent, & Yue Wang

## General Setup
Our code was adapted from UT Austin Villa's released C++ codebase. This codebase can be cloned from <https://github.com/LARG/utaustinvilla3d> and installed (along with its dependencies) by following the repository's `README`. Then, our `naobehavior.h` and `strategy.cc` files need to replace the existing files found at `utaustinvilla3d/behaviors/`.  

## Simulation
The simulation can be run as detailed in the repository's `README`, without modification, via `./start.sh`.
